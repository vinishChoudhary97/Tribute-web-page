                <p><strong>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</strong> was an Indian aerospace scientist and politician
                    who
                    served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil
                    Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist
                    and
                    science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian
                    Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme
                    and
                    military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his
                    work
                    on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal
                    organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first
                    since the original nuclear test by India in 1974. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards,
                    including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.
                    While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died
                    from
                    an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.</p>
